An example of using domain-specific language model pre-trained on biomedical text, to automate the extraction of relevant information such as antipsychotic medications, schizophrenia (schizo), and bipolar disorder (BPD) from clinical notes. This approach can significantly reduce the manual effort required for annotation and improve the scalability of your system. Here's how you could technically implement this:

### Step 1: Preparing BioBERT for Named Entity Recognition (NER)

BioBERT has been pre-trained on vast biomedical literature, including PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text articles, making it well-suited for identifying biomedical entities in text. However, to use BioBERT for NER, you would typically fine-tune it on a dataset that contains labeled examples of the entities you're interested in (e.g., antipsychotic medications, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder).

#### Technical Details:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Prepare a dataset with sentences from clinical notes labeled for the entities of interest. If such a dataset is not readily available, you might start with a smaller manually annotated dataset and gradually expand it using the predictions from BioBERT as you fine-tune the model.

2. **Fine-tuning BioBERT**: Use the Hugging Face `transformers` library to fine-tune BioBERT on your NER task. You will need to adjust the model to output named entity labels instead of its default settings.

### Example Code for Fine-tuning BioBERT on a NER Task

First, you need to install the necessary libraries if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

Then, you can use the following example code as a guideline to fine-tune BioBERT for NER:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizerFast, BertForTokenClassification
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class NERDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts, labels, tokenizer, max_token_len=512):
        self.texts = texts
        self.labels = labels
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.max_token_len = max_token_len

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.texts)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        text = self.texts[idx]
        labels = self.labels[idx]

        encoding = self.tokenizer(text,
                                  padding='max_length',
                                  truncation=True,
                                  max_length=self.max_token_len,
                                  return_tensors="pt")

        encoding['labels'] = torch.tensor(labels, dtype=torch.long)

        return encoding

# Load tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained('dmis-lab/biobert-v1.1')

# Assume `texts` and `labels` are your dataset's features and labels
texts = ["Example sentence about schizophrenia."]
labels = [[0, 1, 2]]  # Example labels for each token in the sentence

# Prepare dataset
dataset = NERDataset(texts, labels, tokenizer)

# Load BioBERT model for token classification (NER)
model = BertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained('dmis-lab/biobert-v1.1', num_labels=3)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir='./logs',
    logging_steps=10,
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset,
    # eval_dataset=dataset,  # If you have a separate validation dataset
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
```

### Using BioBERT for NER

After fine-tuning, BioBERT can be used to identify mentions of antipsychotic medications, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder in clinical notes automatically. This process involves tokenizing the input text, making predictions with the fine-tuned model, and then decoding the predictions back into readable entity labels.

### Incorporating BioBERT into the System

This automated NER step can be integrated into your system before the fine-tuning stage for RAG or directly into the data preprocessing workflow. Using BioBERT for NER can help create a more automated and scalable pipeline for identifying relevant information in clinical notes, reducing the reliance on extensive manual annotation efforts.
